Rumble Chat Sound Extension - Installation Guide
This guide shows you how to install the Rumble Chat Sound Extension as an unpacked extension in Chrome, using files downloaded from GitHub. No GitHub software needed!
Step-by-Step Instructions
Download the Files
Go to the GitHub page for this extension.

Click the green "Code" button.

Choose "Download ZIP".

Save the ZIP file to your computer (e.g., Downloads folder).

Unzip the Files
Find the downloaded ZIP file (like Rumble-Chat-Sound-main.zip).

Right-click it and select "Extract All" (Windows) or double-click (Mac) to unzip it.

You’ll get a folder (e.g., Rumble-Chat-Sound-main). Remember where it is.

Open Chrome Extensions
Open Google Chrome.

In the address bar, type chrome://extensions/ and press Enter.

Enable Developer Mode
Look at the top-right corner of the Extensions page.

Toggle the "Developer mode" switch to ON (it’ll turn blue).

Load the Extension
Click the "Load unpacked" button near the top-left.

A file picker window will open.

Find and select the folder you unzipped (e.g., Rumble-Chat-Sound-main).

Click "Select Folder" or "Open".

Check It’s Working
The extension should appear in your Extensions list, named "Rumble Chat Sound".

Go to a Rumble page with chat (like https://rumble.com/).

Click the extension icon in your Chrome toolbar (looks like a puzzle piece if no custom icon).

Adjust the volume in the popup and test the chat notifications.

Notes
Keep the unzipped folder somewhere safe (don’t delete it) because Chrome needs it to run the extension.

If you update the extension later, download the new ZIP, unzip it, and repeat steps 3-5 with the new folder.

Enjoy your chat notifications!
